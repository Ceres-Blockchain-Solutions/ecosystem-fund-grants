## The title of your grant submission (how do you want us to remember you ðŸ˜Š)
- Gnoland Grants Program Application by Ceres Blockchain Solutions

## Grant type (from examples in Readme)- tinker, builder, researcher
- Researcher, Builder

## A short description of what you are proposing (applies to all submissions)
- Development assistance and support for projects and initiatives within the Gno.land ecosystem
- With our experience in other blockchain ecosystems, we are positioned to participate in the growth and development of Gno.land
- While exploring the Gno.land ecosystem, the focus is on discovering elements and best practices from other ecosystems to contribute to Gno.land's mass adoption

## What is the goal or the purpose of the proposed grant? (applies to all submissions)
Ceres Blockchain Solutions is a software company focused on designing, developing, and implementing software solutions based on Web3. In addition to developing in-house products, we empower innovative minds in the Web3 space to deliver sustainable software solutions that bring their ideas to reality. Some of the products we have built or are currently working on include a zK KYC solution, a carbon credits management platform, a lending/borrowing protocol, play-to-earn games, governance platforms, and DeFi dApps such as farming platforms, liquidity lockers, token lockers, and launchpads.

Our goal is to establish a new ecosystem and actively participate in its development and growth by building dApps that the ecosystem requires or by providing development support to core or other teams.

Following discussions with Michelle and Leon during a call, we propose assigning one person from CBS to explore Gno.land & Gno.lang to better understand the project, engage in development activities, attend developer calls, and contribute in general. After a period of 1 to 2 months, this individual would be able to provide CBS with a clear vision of what Gno.land entails and the opportunities it presents.

Upon the conclusion of this initial exploration phase, armed with insights gained, we anticipate generating ideas for potential projects. These projects may involve porting existing solutions developed for different ecosystems or conceiving entirely new concepts, spanning core infrastructure or application-level innovations.

## Why are you best suited/what is your background (or teamâ€™s if applicable) (applies to all submissions)?
- Developed smart contracts in Solidity across all versions from 0.6.0 to the current ones. Contracts were created to interact with: AaveV2, UniSwapV3, Lens, Balancer. During these integrations, a deep understanding of the architecture of these protocols was acquired.
- Worked with tools such as Foundry, Hardhat, Remix, Truffle, Brownie; tests were written in JavaScript/Typescript and Solidity. Unit tests, e2e tests, and fuzz tests were conducted.
- Utilized many contracts from the OpenZeppelin library, including those for upgrades
- For testing and analysis, the Trail of Bits Ethereum Security Toolbox package was employed, which includes tools like Echidna and Slither, and Mythrill was also used. In addition, arithmetic circuits were written in Noir and Circom.
- Experienced in working with Yul and Huff
- In Polkadot space, working with the Rust language, the Substrate framework, and the ink! smart contract language
- On the backend side, basic tasks such as writing services, repositories, and entities in TypeScript on an existing database were undertaken using NestJS
- Outside of professional engagements, extensive work was done with Python and C, focusing on general programming tasks, basic algorithms, their implementations, and educating students from computer science faculties

## Milestones and overall time frame of your proposal
The proposed research project will span one month initially, with the option to extend it by an additional month.
The price for our smart contract engineer is $10,000 per month. However, for the purpose of research and opening up a new ecosystem for us, we would propose a 20% discount, resulting in a grant amount of $8,000 per month.

### What do you and the submission bring to the Gno.land platform and community?
Our submission brings a wealth of experience and a commitment to innovation to the Gno.land ecosystem and community. Through our exploration of the Gno.land ecosystem, we are going to identify what is needed for the ecosystem to foster bigger contribution from the other participants in the space. We are eager to share our knowledge and be part of building a thriving community here.
